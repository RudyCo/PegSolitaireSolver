# PegSolitaireSolver

Entirely written in C# (Vibe coding!), PegSolitaireSolver is a command-line tool and a desktop application designed to solve the classic peg solitaire puzzle. The program takes an initial board configuration as input and computes a sequence of moves that leads to a solution, if one exists.
